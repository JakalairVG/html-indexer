# html-indexer v1.1
Creates an html file with links to all html files one directory deep.

I download and play a lot of html games, but I have a hard time keeping them all organized in my head.
This goes one directory below where it is placed and searches for any HTML file. (*.html)
Then it makes a simple table with all the files it finds in a 4 column table.

Thing to improve:
  -add optional coloring
  -create an options flag
  -Optional number of columns (done)
  -naming of output file (done)

Changelog

  V1.0
